***** no kidding
** What is this repository?
   This repository I use for storing the source code for my personal
   webpage. As I am a [[mimuw.edu.pl][MIMUW]] student I have my quota on the
   ~students.mimuw.edu.pl~ server where I can host this page (among
   other things). You can acces it *[[https://students.mimuw.edu.pl/~gc429174/][here]]*. For know it is all in the
   [[file:cyr][cyr]] directory as it is based on my old project involving
   cyryllics and html etc but now it suffices... Although in future I
   may try to replace it with some /nice/ webpage like jekyll etc you
   know what im talking about. I'm not into webdev atm but perhaps
   I'll gain some proficiency some day.
